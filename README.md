# Performance Testing Fundamentals

According to the ISTQB Syllabus — CTPT 1.0. Some of the performance tests have similar definitions. It is important to know the concepts of each test separately. In order to have a broader and more assertive analysis of the performance quality of a system, it is also important to combine several of these tests, considering the context and the performance criteria defined for each system. Develop a performance testing plan with the types of tests that can highlight defects in the performance quality according to the established criteria.

In this repository, we will briefly address what will be discussed during the event on Performance Testing where this document is an integral part of the event **QA Solidário - RS Second Edition**
